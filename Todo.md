# DACP Todo List

The following list consists of the large contributions that need to be done to make the program
fully functional. As there is still much work to be done to make the library useful, help is greatly
appreciated.

## List

* Work on a way to access the CCXT API. All Exchanges offered by the CCXT library should be easily
  accessed and interactive.

* Create a framework to hold the transactions dataset. This dataset must be accessible by the API
  commands. Methods should be made to edit the dataset and make it possible to add, delete, order,
  the information. The ways in which it should be customizable is shown in the README explanation.

* At the moment the API_KEYS file will be stored on the users computer, this may change how the API
  is accessed and what the commands may return. As of now, there should be a way to pull the data
  from the API_KEYS file to automatically work with the CCXT library.

More will soon come. If there are any questions on the details provided above, please contact me at
