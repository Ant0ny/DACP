# Digital Asset Central Portfolio
A digital asset personal portfolio using CCXT

DACP is a library that pools together the ledger history and balance sheets of all the exchanges an
investor uses. The library will allow for the access of the dataset and commands that can be used
with it. The library uses CCXT (CryptoCurrency eXchange Trading Library) in order to pull the
information from exchanges.

[CCXT](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt) serves as a library for the access to all the API's for Cryptoasset Exchanges. By using
this as a tool, DACP will work by using this library as a way to access all exchanges and build a
dataset with all the personal information of a user.

The following is a preliminary design of the layout of the library.
